# Privacy Policy
Last updated: 23 Jun 2023  
Sskki (me) publishes apps every now and then. This page is a privacy policy that Google mandated for all apps. I have created this privacy policy to cover all apps I will ever release.
## Information Collection And Use
I personally do not collect any of your information nor have any use for your information.
### Google Play Games Services
When opting in to use Google Play Games Services, Google will collect your username and game-related data such as scores and achievements. This is essential to apps that use global leaderboards and achievement systems (if this app has those features enabled).
## Log Data
Nothing is logged. It's pretty scary how many companies log data, what data they log and how much. But as a person reading a privacy policy at all, I doubt I need to preach to you the importance of online privacy.
Have a nice day!
